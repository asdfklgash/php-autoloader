*** Split the search process in a fast and expensive part ***

There exists a problem with multiple Autoloaders. Each Autoloader
would search a class in its class path until one Autoloader found it.
That means that in a worst case scenario the last Autoloader has cached
the class path. The Autoloaders before that have to search the file
system *every* time.

A solution for this problem would be to split the autoload process into two
tasks. The first is a fast task which searches the index. The second is the
expensive which searches the filesystem. Finding a class is a process which
first iterates through all Autoloaders and starts the fast process. If no
class was found iteration with the expensive task will finish the job.
